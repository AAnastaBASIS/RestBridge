This plugin allows you to deploy BBj or Java classes that follow the development paradigm of "BusinessComponents" as a RESTful web service. It features GET,POST,PUT,DELETE operations that are automatically translated to read, write and remove operation methods in your code.

See https://github.com/BasisHub/ChileCompany for a first naive sample implementation of a BC class on ChileCompany.
